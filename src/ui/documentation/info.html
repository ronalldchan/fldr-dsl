    <h3>Program components</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>RESTRUCTURE:</dt>
      <dd>
        Used at the beginning of all programs to specify the path to the folder that is being restructured. The path
        given will also be the location of the sorted file structure.<br />
        Ex: RESTRUCTURE “C:\\Users\me\pathToMyDirectory”
      </dd>

      <dt>CONDITION:</dt>
      <dd>
        Indicates the declaration of a user-defined function. These functions can be re-used throughout the program as
        part of the CONTAINS clauses.<br />
        Ex: CONDITION: my_condition(year): {DATE_YEAR} < year
      </dd>

      <dt>FOLDER:</dt>
      <dd>
        Indicates the start of a folder. It is followed by the folder’s name, represented as either a string or a
        variable.<br />
        Ex: FOLDER “my_folder”<br />
        Ex: FOLDER “{DATE_YEAR}_photos”<br />
        Ex: FOLDER “{FILE_TYPE}”
      </dd>

      <dt>CONTAINS:</dt>
      <dd>
        Specifies the conditions that any file added to the given folder must meet.<br />
        Ex: FOLDER “pdf_folder”<br />
        CONTAINS: {TYPE} = “pdf”
      </dd>

      <dt>HAS SUBFOLDERS:</dt>
      <dd>
        Used with a set of brackets to contain the subfolders to a given folder.<br />
        Ex: FOLDER “my_folder”<br />
        HAS SUBFOLDERS: [<br />
        &emsp;FOLDER “my_subfolder”<br />
        ]
      </dd>

      <dt>FOREACH:</dt>
      <dd>
        Indicates a for-each loop that will iterate over a list. In each loop, the variable name will be assigned the
        value of the next item in the list.<br />
        Ex: FOREACH year IN [2010, 2011, 2012]<br />
        &emsp;FOLDER “{year}_photos”<br />
        &emsp;CONTAINS: {DATE_YEAR} = {year}
      </dd>

      <dt>INCLUDES:</dt>
      <dd>
        Is true if the string includes the given string.<br />
        Ex: {FILE_NAME} INCLUDES “cat” will return true for files with names “cat_picture01.jpeg” and
        “expo_categories.pdf” but not “ca_today.pdf” or “CAT_picture.jpeg” (because it is case sensitive).
      </dd>

      <dt>ONEOF:</dt>
      <dd>
        Is true if the given variable is one of the items in a given list.<br />
        Ex: {FILE_TYPE} ONEOF [“pdf”, “jpeg”] will return true for “file1.pdf” but not “file2.jpg”.
      </dd>

      <dt>NOT:</dt>
      <dd>
        Negates the operation directly following.<br />
        Ex: NOT my_function(10) is true if my_function(10) is false.
      </dd>

      <dt>OR:</dt>
      <dd>Logical disjunction. (Returns true if any of the conditions joined by the OR are true.)</dd>

      <dt>AND:</dt>
      <dd>Logical conjunction. (Returns true if and only if all the conditions joined by the AND are true.)</dd>

      <dt>IS, &lt;, &gt;, =, &lt;=, &gt;=:</dt>
      <dd>Numeric equality/inequalities.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Built-in variables</h3>
    <p>Any built-in variables used must be contained in brackets (Ex: {FILE_TYPE}.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FILE_SIZE:</strong> Size of a given file (Ex: 34MB)</li>
      <li><strong>FILE_TYPE:</strong> File type (Ex: “pdf”)</li>
      <li><strong>FILE_NAME:</strong> Name of a given file (Ex: “confirmation.pdf”)</li>
      <li><strong>FILE_DATE:</strong> Date of a given file in YYYYMMDD (Ex: 20120423)</li>
      <li><strong>FILE_YEAR:</strong> Year of a given file in YYYY</li>
      <li><strong>FILE_MONTH:</strong> Month of a given file in MM</li>
      <li><strong>FILE_DAY:</strong> Day of a given file in DD</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Note: all time indicators (date, year, month, and day) refer to the date of last modification.</i></p>

    <h3>Other notes</h3>
    <p>A file will be moved into the <i>first</i> folder specified with a condition that is true for that file.
    Folders are considered in the order in which they are written (in a FOREACH, for example), and the root considered after its subfolders.</p>
